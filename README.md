React Router: For client-side routing.

Backend

Node.js: JavaScript runtime for server-side development.
Express.js: Web framework for building RESTful APIs.
Socket.IO: Enables real-time communication between clients and server.
MongoDB: NoSQL database for storing user data and chat history.
Mongoose: ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB.
JSON Web Tokens (JWT): For secure user authentication.
Bcrypt: For hashing passwords.

Development Tools

Vite: Frontend build tool for faster development and optimized builds.
ESLint: For maintaining code quality and consistency.
Prettier: Code formatter for consistent styling.
Docker: For containerizing the application (optional).
Git: Version control system.

Prerequisites

Node.js: Version 18.x or higher.
